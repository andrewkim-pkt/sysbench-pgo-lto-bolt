# Build one PostgreSQL 18.3 arm with gcc 15.2.0 (/opt/gcc15). Runs ON the metal box (AL2023).
#
# gcc 15.2.0 VARIANT of ../pg-build.sh. It differs only in: the compiler and its gcc-ar/ranlib/nm,
# the source tag (REL_18_3), the $OPT-* prefixes and ~/g15 work trees, and AutoFDO + LTO
# (afdolto/afdoltoq) passing -fauto-profile on the COMPILE line as well as the link line, with a
# build-log gate that requires it. Everything else is the published recipe, unchanged.
#
# Extends al-metal-hwpgo-c/pg-build.sh to the full 10-build lattice. Its conventions are kept
# deliberately -- in-tree (non-VPATH) builds, PGO arms reusing the pgogen tree, a `base` arm
# with no debug info and a separate `prep` twin for the profile tools -- so the new arms stay
# comparable with that campaign's published +6.44% / +3.52% BOLT numbers. The additions here
# are the arms it never had: a standalone PGO arm, the whole AutoFDO+LTO family, and the
# BOLT-input twins those need.
#
# SERVER BUILDS (10). Every one is -O3 -march=native -mtune=native plus the row's flags:

#
# CLIENT BUILDS (5), by llvm-bolt in pg-bolt.sh -- AL2023 ships no BOLT, so the binaries and
# perf.data are shuttled to the client:
#   boltonly   llvm-bolt(prep)      arm B        pgoltob  llvm-bolt(pgoltoq)   arm LB
#   afdoltob   llvm-bolt(afdoltoq)  arm AFLB     pgob     llvm-bolt(pgouseq)   arm PB
#   afdob      llvm-bolt(afdoq)     arm AFB
#
# arm PB (PGO+BOLT, no LTO) was added 2026-09-17 on request. It is the one cell the original
# lattice skipped: it isolates BOLT's contribution on top of PGO alone, so PB-vs-P and LB-vs-L
# together say whether BOLT and LTO overlap or compose. Its input twin mirrors pgoltoq -- hot/cold
# splitting stays ON, matching the PGO side's asymmetry #1 below rather than the AutoFDO side's.
#
# => 9 benchmarked arms (A B P PB L LB AF AFL AFLB) from 14 builds. Five builds are never
#    benchmarked: prep, pgogen, pgouseq, afdoq, pgoltoq, afdoltoq.
#
# THREE DELIBERATE ASYMMETRIES, to state in the writeup:
#  1. afdoltoq disables hot/cold splitting; pgoltoq does NOT. BOLT handles pre-split functions
#     badly and -fauto-profile turns splitting on, but the PGO side keeps it on because that is
#     what the prior campaign measured and staying comparable to it is the point.
#  2. afdolto/afdoltoq pass the profile on the COMPILE and the link line. The published gcc 14.2.1
#     script put it on the link line only, to dodge a reported -flto + -fauto-profile ICE, and
#     that applies no profile (AutoFDO runs per TU before LTO streaming). Retested 2026-09-30 on
#     PG 18.3: gcc 15.2.0 (and 14.2.1) build it with zero ICEs, and .text differs from a plain
#     LTO control, so the profile is applied. The gate below requires -fauto-profile in the
#     compile commands; an ICE would fail the build and be listed by the make-failed grep.
#  3. base carries no -g and no -Wl,-q: it is the binary a normal user would build. The BOLT
#     and AutoFDO inputs live in `prep` instead of being folded into the baseline.
#
# SOURCE: branch `p183-base` of the git checkout at /home/ec2-user/postgres ON THIS SERVER =
# STOCK PostgreSQL 18.3 (62d6c7d3df6 "Stamp 18.3."), zero commits beyond REL_18_3,
# NUM_XLOGINSERT_LOCKS at its stock 8, tree eacca3d098ca. Verified identical to the client repo's
# `p183` branch (same tree hash) -- the branch NAMES differ between the two boxes, the trees do
# not. Stock is chosen so the compiler effect is measured against unmodified upstream and stays
# comparable to the prior campaign's numbers, which were also taken on stock.
#
# The client repo's other p183* branches carry performance patches (p183-z3s-spinbackoff is
# REL_18_3+5 with s_lock exponential backoff, lwlock spin rework, and NUM_XLOGINSERT_LOCKS raised
# to 64). Building an arm from one of those and comparing it against a stock arm would report a
# SOURCE change as a compiler win. Each arm's tree is exported from git by revision and the
# revision is echoed by every gate block below, so no binary here can be mistaken for another tree.
#
# `git archive` per arm, rather than a shipped tarball: it guarantees a pristine tree with no build
# products and no local edits, and it removes the shipped-tarball-drifts-from-the-repo failure mode
# entirely. GITREV overrides the revision; SRCREPO overrides the repo.

# Functional smoke. -flto on PostgreSQL is the real risk: the backend exports symbols that

# than a build failure, because it looks like a valid arm.
# GCOV_PREFIX sends the instrumented smoke run's counters somewhere disposable -- without it,
# initdb + a trivial SELECT would write .gcda into the pgogen tree and contaminate the training
# profile with bootstrap/DDL paths before HammerDB has run a single transaction.
